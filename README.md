# HadoopPractice
Repo containing several practices for the Cloudera CCA certification

retail_db_practice: this folder contains general practice using the mysql retail_db on the Cloudera virtual machine.
  I have Sqoop commands that import the database into Hadoop.  I also have many Spark scripts that perform joins and aggregations.  This folder is purely for practicing tools in the Hadoop Stack
